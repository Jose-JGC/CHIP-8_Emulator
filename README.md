# CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a simple **CHIP-8 Emulator** implemented in C++.

## Description

The CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, originally created for an early generation of home computers in the 1970s. This project emulates the behavior of a CHIP-8 virtual machine to run CHIP-8 programs (games or applications).

## Features

- Emulates the CHIP-8 virtual machine.
- Supports running CHIP-8 programs (`.rom` files).
- Implemented using C++.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: You will need a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang`, or MSVC).
- **CMake**: To build and configure the project.
